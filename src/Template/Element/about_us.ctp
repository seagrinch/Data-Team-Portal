<p>This portal supports the <em>OOI Synthesis & Education</em> project that was conducted by Rutgers University, and led by the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.  The team was tasked with reviewing and evaluating  the official datasets collected by the OOI 1.0 effort, from July 2013 to September 2018.</p>

<p>A final summary of issues documented during the data review can be found in the <?= $this->html->link('OOI 1.0 Data Evaluation Summary Report','OOISE Data Evaluation Report FINAL.pdf')?>.</p>
